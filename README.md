The package already contains release and debug build in 'build\' directory.
If you prefer to re-build it from sources perform the following steps:

1. **Install build system**

   The build system is based on Grunt, The JavaScript Task Runner.
   Grunt is installed and managed via npm, the Node.js package manager.
   - Download and install Node.js from http://nodejs.org web site.
   - Install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally.
     You may need to use sudo (for OSX, *nix, BSD etc) or run your command
     shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this. To install Grunt CLI run
     command:

     `npm install -g grunt-cli`

2. **Install build dependencies**

   Change current working directory to Controls.js Package root and run:

     `npm install`

3. **Run build tool**

     `grunt`

   Now you'll find the built files in 'build\' directory.
